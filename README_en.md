### [Update 2023.12.24]: Release of V2.3

Major Changes:

* All models have been retrained, offering higher accuracy than the previous version.
* Models are categorized into several types based on usage scenarios (see [Pre-trained Recognition Models](#pre-trained-recognition-models)):
  * `scene`: For scene images, suitable for recognizing text in general photography. Models in this category start with `scene-`, such as the `scene-densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
  * `doc`: For document images, suitable for recognizing text in regular document screenshots, like scanned book pages. Models in this category start with `doc-`, such as the `doc-densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
  * `number`: Specifically for recognizing **only numbers** (able to recognize only the ten digits `0~9`), suitable for scenarios like bank card numbers, ID numbers, etc. Models in this category start with `number-`, such as the `number-densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
  * `general`: For general scenarios, suitable for images without a clear preference. Models in this category do not have a specific prefix and maintain the same naming convention as older versions, such as the `densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
  > Note ⚠️: The above descriptions are for reference only. It is recommended to choose models based on actual performance.
* Two larger series of models have been added:
  * `*-densenet_lite_246-gru_base`: Initially available for **Planet of Knowledge** [**CnOCR/CnSTD Private Group**](https://t.zsxq.com/FEYZRJQ) members, to be open-sourced for free after one month.
  * `*-densenet_lite_666-gru_large`: Pro models, available for use after purchase. Purchase link can be found at [https://ocr.lemonsqueezy.com](https://ocr.lemonsqueezy.com/).

## Documentation

See [CnOCR online documentation](https://cnocr.readthedocs.io/) , in Chinese.

## Usage

Starting from **V2.2**, **CnOCR** internally uses the text detection engine **[CnSTD](https://github.com/breezedeus/cnstd)** for text detection and positioning. So **CnOCR** V2.2 can recognize not only typographically simple printed text images, such as screenshot images, scanned copies, etc., but also **scene text in general images**.

Here are some examples of usages for different scenarios.


## Usages for Different Scenarios

### Common image recognition

Just use default values for all parameters. If you find that the result is not good enough, try different parameters more to see the effect, and usually you will end up with a more desirable accuracy.

```python
from cnocr import CnOcr

img_fp = './docs/examples/huochepiao.jpeg'
ocr = CnOcr()  # Use default values for all parameters
out = ocr.ocr(img_fp)

print(out)
```

Recognition results:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/predict-outputs/huochepiao.jpeg-result.jpg" alt="Train ticket recognition" width="800px"/>
</div>



### English Recognition

Although Chinese detection and recognition models can also recognize English, **detectors and recognizers trained specifically for English texts tend to be more accurate**. For English-only application scenarios, it is recommended to use the English detection model `det_model_name='en_PP-OCRv3_det'` and the English recognition model `rec_model_name='en_PP-OCRv3'` from  [**PaddleOCR**](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) (also called **ppocr**).

```python
from cnocr import CnOcr

img_fp = './docs/examples/en_book1.jpeg'
ocr = CnOcr(det_model_name='en_PP-OCRv3_det', rec_model_name='en_PP-OCRv3')
out = ocr.ocr(img_fp)

print(out)
```

Recognition results:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/predict-outputs/en_book1.jpeg-result.jpg" alt="Recognition of English texts" width="600px"/>
</div>


### Recognition of typographically screenshot images

For **typographically simple typographic text images**, such as screenshot images, scanned images, etc., you can use `det_model_name='naive_det'`, which is equivalent to not using a text detection model, but using simple rules for branching.

> **Note**
>
> `det_model_name='naive_det'` is equivalent to CnOCR versions before `V2.2` (`V2.0.*`, `V2.1.*`).

The biggest advantage of using `det_model_name='naive_det'` is that the speech is **fast** and the disadvantage is that it is picky about images. How do you determine if you should use the detection model `'naive_det'`? The easiest way is to take your application image and try the effect, if it works well, use it, if not, don't.

```python
from cnocr import CnOcr

img_fp = './docs/examples/multi-line_cn1.png'
ocr = CnOcr(det_model_name='naive_det') 
out = ocr.ocr(img_fp)

print(out)
```

Recognition results:

<div align="center">

</div>

### Vertical text recognition

Chinese recognition model `rec_model_name='ch_PP-OCRv3'` from **ppocr**  is used for recognition.

```python
from cnocr import CnOcr

img_fp = './docs/examples/shupai.png'
ocr = CnOcr(rec_model_name='ch_PP-OCRv3')
out = ocr.ocr(img_fp)

print(out)
```

Recognition results:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/predict-outputs/shupai.png-result.jpg" alt="vertical text recognition" width="800px"/>
</div>

### Traditional Chinese Recognition

Use the traditional Chinese recognition model from ppocr `rec_model_name='english_cht_PP-OCRv3'` for recognition.

```python
from cnocr import CnOcr

img_fp = './docs/examples/fanti.jpg'
ocr = CnOcr(rec_model_name='chinese_cht_PP-OCRv3')  # use the traditional Chinese recognition model
out = ocr.ocr(img_fp)

print(out)
```

When using this model, please note the following issues:

* The recognition accuracy is average and not very good.

* The recognition of punctuation, English and numbers is not good except for traditional Chinese characters.

* This model does not support the recognition of vertical text.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/predict-outputs/fanti.jpg-result.jpg" alt="traditional Chinese recognition" width="700px"/>
</div>

### Single line text image recognition

If it is clear that the image to be recognized is a single line text image (as shown below), you can use the class function `CnOcr.ocr_for_single_line()` for recognition. This saves the time of text detection and will be more than twice as fast.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/examples/helloworld.jpg" alt="single line text image recognition" width="300px"/>
</div>

The code is as follows:

```python
from cnocr import CnOcr

img_fp = './docs/examples/helloworld.jpg'
ocr = CnOcr()
out = ocr.ocr_for_single_line(img_fp)
print(out)
```

## Install

Well, one line of command is enough if it goes well.

```bash
$ pip install cnocr[ort-cpu]
```

If you are using a **GPU** environment with an ONNX model, please install using the following command:

```bash
$ pip install cnocr[ort-gpu]
```

If you want to train new models with your own data, please install using the following command:

```bash
$ pip install cnocr[dev]
```

If the installation is slow, you can specify a domestic installation source, such as using the Aliyun source: 

```bash
$ pip install cnocr -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple
```

> **Note** 
>
> Please use **Python3** (3.6 and later should work), I haven't tested if it's okay under Python2.

More instructions can be found in the [installation documentation](https://cnocr.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/install/) (in Chinese).

> **Warning** 
>
> If you have never installed `PyTorch`, `OpenCV` python packages on your computer, you may encounter problems with the first installation, but they are usually common problems that can be solved by Baidu/Google.


### Docker Image

You can directly pull the image with CnOCR installed from Docker Hub: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/breezedeus) . 

```bash
$ docker pull breezedeus/cnocr:latest
```

### Pre-trained Recognition Models

Compared to the CnOCR V2.2.* versions, most models in **V2.3** have been retrained and fine-tuned, offering higher accuracy than the older versions. Additionally, two series of models with larger parameter volumes have been added:

  * `*-densenet_lite_246-gru_base`: Currently available for **Knowledge Planet** [**CnOCR/CnSTD Private Group**](https://t.zsxq.com/FEYZRJQ) members, it will be open-sourced for free in February 2024.
  * `*-densenet_lite_666-gru_large`: **Pro models**, available for use after purchase. The purchase link: [https://ocr.lemonsqueezy.com](https://ocr.lemonsqueezy.com).

Models in **V2.3** are categorized into the following types based on usage scenarios:

* `scene`: For scene images, suitable for recognizing text in general photography. Models in this category start with `scene-`, such as the `scene-densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
* `doc`: For document images, suitable for recognizing text in regular document screenshots, like scanned book pages. Models in this category start with `doc-`, such as the `doc-densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
* `number`: Specifically for recognizing **only numbers** (able to recognize only the ten digits `0~9`), suitable for scenarios like bank card numbers, ID numbers, etc. Models in this category start with `number-`, such as the `number-densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
* `general`: For general scenarios, suitable for images without a clear preference. Models in this category do not have a specific prefix and maintain the same naming convention as older versions, such as the `densenet_lite_136-gru` model.
